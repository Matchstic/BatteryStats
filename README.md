BatteryStats
=============

This is a small library useful for HTML widgets developers (iOS) to query current battery statistics. It outputs a .txt file at /var/mobile/Library/BatteryStats.txt which can be queried via jQuery etc. Plus, it has a user-configurable refresh rate as to how often the battery statistics are retreived, located at /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/BatteryStats-prefs.plist

<strong>Anything else?</strong>
Yep! It's also a great working example of using SBUIController to get the battery percentage to a 1% degree of accuracy with ease.
